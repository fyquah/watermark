# Watermark

A simple program to produce a watermark on an important document. This program also resizes the image to a smaller size, as most site accepts small images only.

watermark -s "For github only" id.png -o output.png
```

before:

![before image][./sample_before.png]

after:

![after image][./sample_after.png]
